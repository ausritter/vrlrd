Cheqd,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cheqd,For Profit,Private,Seed,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, FinTech, Identity Management","Cheqd is a Web 3.0 startup founded by an ambitious and experienced team in the field of self-sovereign identity (SSI). SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable. Through our network, anyone can verify identities quickly and securely with the ability for organisations checking the data to be compensated for their work.","London, England, United Kingdom",11-50,Active,3300000,USD,3300000,2600000,USD,2600000,2021-09-22,contact@cheqd.io

Forte,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/forte-global,For Profit,Private,Seed,"Education, Finance, Financial Services, FinTech, Health Care","FORTE (which stands for Financing Of Return To Employment) is a way to finance education and healthcare, at no cost to individuals or governments, and without relying on philanthropy. The FORTE approach was invented by Dr Nat Ware as part of his Oxford PhD on a Rhodes Scholarship. With the FORTE approach, the cost of high-quality education (such as retraining) and healthcare (such as cataract eye surgery) is paid for by investors. Individuals who receive these services pay nothing - either now or in the future. Instead, investors receive a portion of any increase in future taxation revenue caused by those services. Think of it as ""Future Lydia's taxes paying for Present Lydia's training"". In a nutshell, it works in three steps: 1. Via Forte, investors can pay for the services of individuals who would otherwise be paying no or negligible tax. 2. These services (such as vocational retraining), by their nature, increase expected employment, incomes, and therefore government income tax revenue. 3. Governments, as part of the contractual arrangement, pass back to investors (via Forte) an agreed portion of the tax revenue attributable to the training recipients, for a set period of time. This arrangement is mutually beneficial.  Individuals receive training at no cost and with no risk. They just pay the usual tax rate. They’re effectively paying for their own training with their future tax. Governments pay nothing upfront. They can increase the skilled modern workforce, overcome skill gaps, and help those in need, without worsening the budget. Importantly, there are easy mathematical ways of structuring the contract so they only pass on in the future what they otherwise would not have had. In other words, the FORTE model pays for itself in a guaranteed way. Investors get low-risk, short-term returns. They can do well while doing good. There is perfect alignment of social impact and financial returns.  A true win-win.","New York, New York, United States",11-50,Active,6600000,USD,6600000,5600000,USD,5600000,2020-11-01,info@forteofficial.com

Hashstack scales upon the foundations of incumbent money markets (Compound, Aave, Euler Finance) by addressing the blindspots & grey areas for better-balanced risks, and value-add for the system participants, with composability at its core.  A basic summary of Hashstack's Open is as follows: Developed on the protocol of the same name, through Open, anyone anywhere worldwide can borrow up to three times their collateral, completely permission-less, without the need for trusted 3rd parties. That is, one can borrow up to US$300 with collateral of as little as US$100. This is 328% more loan against the collateral when compared to the incumbent money markets — Compound, Aave, MakerDao. The $300 loan can be spent in two ways. 1. Use the loan in its entirety as trading capital. 2. Withdraw a portion[ up to $70, i.e. up to 70% collateral equivalent] into the borrower’s personal wallet, with the balance of $230 staying within the protocol to be used as trading capital. The ownership of the balance loan remains with the Open, with the borrower having the right to spend. Open integrates dapps of critical novelty across zk L2 & L1s, where the loan can be spent. For, eg, A borrower can trade the $300 loan for equivalent BTC on DyDx on Starknet. Here, the transfer of assets happens on a protocol level between Open & DyDx, while the state change of the loan market is recorded for the borrower. If the trade returns a positive yield, the borrower makes a profit, which is for his to keep. The borrower can repay the debt and exit the transaction with positive returns.","Old Road Town, Saint Thomas Middle Island, Saint Kitts and Nevis",11-50,Active,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,2022-01-01,hello@hashstack.finance
